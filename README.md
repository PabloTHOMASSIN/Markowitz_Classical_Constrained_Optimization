ESILV A4 Project "Markowitz Portfolio Optimization"

## Introduction
Hello everyone,

I am excited to present our ESILV A4 project: "Markowitz Portfolio Optimization." This project delves into the realm of modern portfolio theory by exploring the principles of Markowitz's mean-variance optimization for portfolio construction.

In this GitHub repository, we have compiled all the essential components of our project, including Python code implementations, documentation, and relevant resources. Our primary objective is to showcase the application of Markowitz's theory in constructing efficient portfolios that balance risk and return optimally.

Through this project, we aim to provide insights into the process of portfolio optimization and demonstrate how mathematical optimization techniques can be leveraged to design portfolios that meet investors' specific objectives and constraints.

We invite you to explore our GitHub repository and engage with us by sharing your thoughts, feedback, or questions. Your participation is invaluable in fostering discussion and advancing our understanding of portfolio optimization strategies.

Thank you for joining us on this journey through the world of Markowitz Portfolio Optimization!

Best regards,
